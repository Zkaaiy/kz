            <li>Fantasy Football.  I fist got involved with it in 2013.  In a 12-man Yahoo
            league.  My draft wasn't promising, according to Yahoo's automated analysis.  Wrong...they were wrong!  
            I took the Championship, my first year, with Tony Gonzalez, Tom Brady, and Chicago's defense.  The following
            three years, resulted in top five finishes.  Decided to take a break because I invested too much into my own
            research...losing sleep, quality time with family, and my efficency at work.  Fast foward to now and I began
            2022 season not so good.  Take note: Read your league rules and understand it.  I joined a superflex ESPN
            league, which meant QB's will fly off the board.  I drafted as if it was a typical league, where
            only one QB is played.  Dispite that hiccup, I took the belt!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Drawing.  I took interest into my creative side, sophmore year in High School.
                I entered an art competition, at school, and received an honorable mentioned ribbon.  I look at freehand
                drawing, now as a way to ease my mind.  As ironic as that sounds, due to the absence of guidelines or
                grids for assistance, I just love it when a totaly, blank paper results in a near duplication of that
                person or thing.</a></li>
            <br>
            <li>Food.  I like to eat, as we all should.  Very essential to our livelihood.  At a very
                young age, I spontaneously joined a pie eating contest at a local festival.  Can't remember the flavor of
                the pie but I did win that pig throphy.  I entered a phase in my life where i enjoyed prepping and cooking
                my own meals.  Honestly, it was motivated by my need to stay in physical shape while in the Army.  Nutrition
                factors into achieving and maintaing tip-top form.  As now, I'm retired...I enjoy my wife's awesome cooking
                and venturing to restaraunts of our liking.</li>
